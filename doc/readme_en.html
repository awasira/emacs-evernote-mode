2 Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</p>
<p>
Emacs evernote mode offers functions to refer and edit Evernote notes directly from Emacs. Currently this package offers the following interfaces.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Command: evernote-open-note</b>

<p>
Read an existing note to an Emacs buffer. At first, input tags attached to the notes, then input the name of the note on the minibuffer.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Command: evernote-save-note (default bound to \C-x\C-s)</b>

<p>
Save the modified note.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Command: evernote-create-note</b>

<p>
Create a note from scratch.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Command: evernote-write-note</b>

<p>
Create a new note from the current buffer.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Command: evernote-post-region</b>

<p>
Create a new note containing the selected region. If you call this command without argument, no buffer associated with the new note is generated, which is different from evernote-open-note and evernote-create-note. If you call this command with an argument by \C-u etc.(not default argument), it creates a new buffer associated with the new note and you can edit the note in the buffer.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Command: evernote-edit-tags (default bound to \C-cet)</b>

<p>
Change tags attached to the note. The change on Evernote service will be made after exec of evernote-save-note.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Command: evernote-change-edit-mode (default bound to \C-cee)</b>

<p>
Change the edit mode of the note. (See [Evernote note edit mode] for details) The change on Evernote service will be made after exec of evernote-save-note.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Command: evernote-rename-note (default bound to \C-cer)</b>

<p>
Rename the note. The change on Evernote service will be made after exec of evernote-save-note.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Command: evernote-delete-note (default bound to \C-ced)</b>

<p>
Delete the note.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Command: evernote-search-notes</b>

<p>
Search notes by query in the minibuffer. (See [Search Query Examples] for details)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Command: evernote-do-saved-search</b>

<p>
Search notes by using a Saved Search.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Command: evernote-create-search</b>

<p>
Save a query with a name for later use.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Command: evernote-edit-search</b>

<p>
Change the name and the query of an existing Saved Search.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Command: evernote-toggle-read-only (default bound to \C-x\C-q)</b>

<p>
Toggle read-only status of the note. When a note of XHTML mode is changed to the read-only status, the command in the variable evernote-enml-formatter-command formats the XHTML. See [Evernote note edit mode] for details.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Variable: evernote-enml-formatter-command</b>

<p>
The command to format XHTML. When a note of XHTML mode is read-only, the command formats the XHTML and displays it. Currently evernote-mode supports w3m as the formatter.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Command: evernote-browser</b>

<p>
Open Evernote Browser. Evernote Browser offers the features to open notes from the tag hierarchical list, the saved search list and the note list of the past search result. See [Evernote Browser] for details.
</p>
</li>
</ul>When you create a note by evernote-create-note, evernote-write-note and evernote-post-region, you can attach tags to the note.
Also, when using the commands, you can input the name and the tag of the note with completion in the minibuffer.


<p>
The minor-mode "evernote-mode" is applied to the buffers opening the evernote note. The following commands are available only when "evernote-mode" is valid.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
evernote-save-note
</li>
<li>
evernote-edit-tags
</li>
<li>
evernote-change-edit-mode
</li>
<li>
evernote-rename-note
</li>
<li>
evernote-delete-note


</li>
</ul>(INVISIBLE)

3 Evernote note edit mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</p>
<p>
Evernote notes are XML complying with ENML DTD([http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd]). evernote-mode offers the two edit mode, XHTML mode and TEXT mode for saving and reading the Evenote notes.
</p>

<p>
3.1 XHTML mode
==============
</p>
<p>
When you save the Evernote note in XHTML mode, the content of the buffer will be saved as the content of the note. Therefore if the contents of the buffer is not valid ENML, you cannot save the contents because of the error.
</p>
<p>
And when you read a Evernote note by using XHTML mode, the buffer is read-only as the initial state. If the variable evernote-enml-formatter-command is set, the content of the buffer is formatted. (See [Install and Settings] for details of setting evernote-enml-formatter-command) If you toggle the read-only status and change it to read-write, unformatted XHTML is displayed in the buffer. The buffer will display the formatted text if you change the state to read-only again.
</p>

   -----------------------------------
</p>

<p>
3.2 TEXT mode
=============
</p>
<p>
In XHTML mode, you have to edit a XHTML as a text but it is a complicated work. evernote-mode offers TEXT mode to make editing text notes easy and effective.
</p>
<p>
The text mode is specialized in editing Evernote notes that only contain text content. When you save an Evernote note, special characters(&amp;keyword; space, newline) in the buffer are escaped and the root element is added to transform it into a XML document. Therefore text contents in the Emacs buffer is same as the appearance of the note. (is not same as the actual XML content of the note.) And when you read a Evernote note by using TEXT mode, evernote-mode reads the contents under the root element of the XML as a text and all the special characters are unescaped then evernote-mode insert it to the buffer.
</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>
3.3 Select edit mode
====================
</p>
<p>
You can select the edit mode when you create a note. The edit mode is recorded in the note when you save it, and the recorded edit mode is applied to the note when you reopen it.
</p>

<p>
3.4 Change edit mode
====================
</p>
<p>
Use the command evernote-change-edit-mode to change the edit mode of the existing note. If you change the edit mode from XHTML mode to TEXT mode and the buffer is read-only, then the content of the TEXT mode is the formatted text. Note that the change will remove all format information(xml tags). If the buffer is read-write, the content of the TEXT mode is the original unformatted text.

4 Search Query Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</p>
<p>
Here are examples of queries used for searching notes.
</p>
<p>
The following examples are referred from ([http://www.evernote.com/about/developer/api/evernote-api.htm#<sub>Toc277181479]</sub>).
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Find notes containing the word "chicken", tagged with "cooking", and created this year:

</li>
</ul>chicken tag:cooking created:year

<ul>
<li>
Find notes tagged with "cooking" but not "mexican" that include the word "beef" but not the word "carrots"

</li>
</ul>tag:cooking -tag:mexican beef -carrots

<ul>
<li>
Find notes in my "Travel" notebook with San Francisco in the title:

</li>
</ul>notebook:Travel intitle:"San Francisco"

<ul>
<li>
Find notes that either include the text "San Francisco" or are tagged with the "SFO" tag:

</li>
</ul>any: "San Francisco" tag:SFO

5 Evernote Browser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</p>
<p>
Evernote Browser offers the features to open notes from the tag hierarchical list, the saved search list, and the note list of the past search result. These lists are different from the completion lists of evernote-open-note command or the evernote-search-notes command. These lists of Evernote Browser are always kept in Emacs buffers until they are deleted by the user after they were created, and they make the procedure to open notes easy by using these list repeatedly.
</p>
<p>
Evernote Browser is composed of multiple Evernote Browser pages(emacs buffers). An Evernote Browser page is created when searching notes or when executing the evernote-browser command at the state that no search has been executed. The multiple pages are managed as the page list. There is one valid current page and each page has the next/previous page. Execute the evernote-browser command to move the cursor to the current Evernote Browser page. Also, use the keys for moving to the next/previous page key (described later) to move to another page.
</p>
<p>
There are three type of Evernote Browser page
</p>
<ul>
<li>
tag list page
</li>
<li>
saved search list page
</li>
<li>
note list page
</li>
<li>
notebook list page

</li>
</ul>A tag list page shows the hierarchical tag list created on Evernote service. Pressing Enter(\C-m) on the tag name opens a note list page of the tag.

<p>
A saved search list shows the search list created on Evernote service. Pressing Enter(\C-m) on the search name opens a note list page from the search result.
</p>
<p>
A note list shows the note list from a note search result. The note list page is newly created by the evenote-open-note command, the evernote-search-notes command and by searches on Evernote Browser. Pressing Enter(\C-m) on the note name opens a note.
</p>
<p>
A notebook list page shows the notebook list created on Evernote service. Pressing Enter(\C-m) on the notebook name opens a note list page associated with the notebook.
</p>
<p>
The followings are other key assignments on Evernote Browser pages
</p><table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<COL align="left"><COL align="left">
<thead>
<tr><th>Key</th><th>Action</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>b</td><td>move to the previous page</td></tr>
<tr><td>f</td><td>move to the next page</td></tr>
<tr><td>t</td><td>create a tag list page and show it. If a tag list page already exists, move the cursor to the page</td></tr>
<tr><td>S</td><td>create a search list page and show it. If a tag list page already exists, move the cursor to the page</td></tr>
<tr><td>s</td><td>create a note list from the search query input and show it</td></tr>
<tr><td>N</td><td>create a notebook list page and show it. If a notebook list page already exists, move the cursor to the page</td></tr>
<tr><td>o</td><td>same as Enter(\C-m), but it does not move the cursor to the opened note</td></tr>
<tr><td>n</td><td>move to the next line and open the note on the cursor if in the note list,</td></tr>
<tr><td>n</td><td>move to the previous line and open the note on the cursor if in the note list,</td></tr>
<tr><td>d</td><td>delete the current from Evernote Browser</td></tr>

7 Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<p>
7.1 `require': no such file to load -- gdbm
===========================================
</p>
<p>
Some distributions do not have the GDBM library for ruby. Install libgdbm-ruby for using GDBM.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
ex. for apt,


</li>
</ul>apt-get install libgdbm-ruby
@/&lt;pre&gt;

<p>
7.2 `require': no such file to load -- net/https
================================================
</p>
<p>
Some distributions do not have the openssl library for ruby. Install libopenssl-ruby for using https.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
ex. for apt,


</li>
</ul>apt-get install libopenssl-ruby
