Introduction
============

Emacs evernote mode offers functions to refer and edit
Evernote notes directly from Emacs. Currently this package offers the
following commands.


* evernote-open-note
  Read an existing note to an Emacs buffer. Tag search is also
  available. You can input the name and the tag of the note with
  completion in the minibuffer.

* evernote-save-note (default bound to \C-x\C-s)
  Save the modified note.

* evernote-create-note
  Create a note from scratch.

* evernote-write-note (default bound to \C-cee)
  Create a new note from the current buffer.
  You can attach tags to the note when creating the note.

* evernote-edit-tags (default bound to \C-cet)
  Change tags attached to the note. The change on Evernote service
  will be made after exec of evernote-save-note.

* evernote-change-edit-mode (default bound to \C-cee)
  Change the edit mode of the note. (See "Evernote note edit mode" for
  details) The change on Evernote service will be made after exec of
  evernote-save-note.

* evernote-rename-note (default bound to \C-cer)
  Rename the note. The change on Evernote service will be made after
  exec of evernote-save-note.

* evernote-delete-note (default bound to \C-ced)
  Delete the note.


After calling evernote-open-note or evernote-write-note,
they validate the minor-mode "evernote-mode" in the buffer.

The following commands are available only when "evernote-mode" is valid.
- evernote-save-note
- evernote-edit-tags
- evernote-change-edit-mode
- evernote-rename-note
- evernote-delete-note


Evernote note edit mode
=========================

Evernote notes are XML complying with ENML
DTD(http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd).
evernote-mode offers the two edit mode, XHTML mode and TEXT mode for
saving and reading the Evenote notes.

When you save the Evernote note, the content of the buffer will be
saved as the content of the note. Therefore if the contents of the
buffer is not valid ENML, you cannot save the contents because of the
error. And when you read a Evernote note by using XHTML mode, the XML
document is read "as is" to the Emacs buffer.


An example of XHTML mode editing:

   Emacs Buffer
   -----------------------------------
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE en-note SYSTEM "http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd">
   <en-note>Evernote notes are XML complying with ENML DTD<br clear="none"/>
   evernote-mode offers the two edit mode, XHTML mode and TEXT mode for<br clear="none"/>
   saving and reading the Evenote notes.<br clear="none"/>
   </en-note>
   -----------------------------------
   |
   | save on XHTML mode
   V
   The content of the note (same as the emacs buffer)
   -----------------------------------
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE en-note SYSTEM "http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd">
   <en-note>Evernote notes are XML complying with ENML DTD<br clear="none"/>
   evernote-mode offers the two edit mode, XHTML mode and TEXT mode for<br clear="none"/>
   saving and reading the Evenote notes.<br clear="none"/>
   </en-note>
   -----------------------------------
   |
   | read on XHTML mode
   V
   Emacs Buffer (same as the content of the note)
   -----------------------------------
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE en-note SYSTEM "http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd">
   <en-note>Evernote notes are XML complying with ENML DTD<br clear="none"/>
   evernote-mode offers the two edit mode, XHTML mode and TEXT mode for<br clear="none"/>
   saving and reading the Evenote notes.<br clear="none"/>
   </en-note>
   -----------------------------------


The text mode is specialized in editing Evernote notes that only
contain text content.
When you save an Evernote note, special characters(&keyword; space,
newline) in the buffer are escaped and the root element is added
to transform it into a XML document. Therefore text contents in the
Emacs buffer is same as the appearance of the note. (is not same as
the actual XML content of the note.)
And when you read a Evernote note by using TEXT mode, evernote-mode
reads the contents under the root element of the XML as a text and all
the special characters are unescaped then evernote-mode insert it to
the buffer.


An example of TEXT mode editing:

   Emacs Buffer
   -----------------------------------
   Evernote notes are XML complying with ENML DTD
   evernote-mode offers the two edit mode, XHTML mode and TEXT mode for
   saving and reading the Evenote notes.
   -----------------------------------
   |
   | save on TEXT mode
   V
   The content of the note (escaped and transformed into a XML)
   -----------------------------------
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE en-note SYSTEM "http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd">
   <en-note>Evernote notes are XML complying with ENML DTD<br clear="none"/>
   evernote-mode offers the two edit mode, XHTML mode and TEXT mode for<br clear="none"/>
   saving and reading the Evenote notes.<br clear="none"/>
   </en-note>
   -----------------------------------
   |
   | read on TEXT mode
   V
   Emacs Buffer (unescaped and transformed int a text)
   -----------------------------------

   evernote-mode offers the two edit mode, XHTML mode and TEXT mode for
   saving and reading the Evenote notes.
   -----------------------------------


You can select the edit mode when you create a note or when you call
evernote-change-edit-mode. The edit mode is recorded in the note when
you save it, and the recorded edit mode is adapted when you reopen the
note.
Notes created by other Evernote applications are read as XHTML mode,
but you can change the edit-mode by evernote-change-edit-mode.

evernote-mode doesn't offer any rich function for editing XML, so it
is not appropriate for editing notes created other Evernote
applications.
The main usage of evernote-mode is to create and edit notes as TEXT
mode.
